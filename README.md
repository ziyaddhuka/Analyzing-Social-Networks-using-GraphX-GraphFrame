Analyzing Social Networks using GraphX/GraphFrame


Run the following queries using the GraphX/GraphFrame API and write your output to a file specified by the output parameter.

a. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest outdegree and find the count of the number of outgoing edges in each

b. Find the top 5 nodes with the highest indegree and find the count of the number of incoming edges in each

c. Calculate PageRank for each of the nodes and output the top 5 nodes with the highest PageRank values. You are free to define any suitable parameters.

d. Run the connected components algorithm on it and find the top 5 components with the largest number of nodes.

e. Run the triangle counts algorithm on each of the vertices and output the top 5 vertices with the
largest triangle count. In case of ties, you can randomly select the top 5 vertices.
